# Changelog

This file tracks changes across development of the `convnwb` module.

## 0.2.X Version

The `0.2.X` series, starting with the `0.2.0` tagged release is an update to the stable
release version of the module. This updated version has several minor updates with
previous version, but does not maintain complete consistency with previous versions.

Key changes include:
- adding official support up to Python 3.11
- updates to the objects, including adding new methods
- the addition of the `run` sub-module, which includes moving some functions

## 0.1.X Version

The `0.1.X` series, starting with the `0.1.0` tagged release is the first stable release
of the module. This release version is considered a stable release, and should maintain
compatibility across the `0.1.X` series, with no breaking changes.

## Development Version

Prior to the 0.1.0 release, there was continuous updates under the development version,
which was listed under `0.1.0-dev` version tag.

Through this time, the general layout and organization matched what became the `0.1.0` version,
however, there could be breaking changes at any time, and compatibility which future
tagged versions is not guaranteed.
